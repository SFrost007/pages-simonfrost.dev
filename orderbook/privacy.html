    <h1>The No-Nonsense Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>I don't store or transmit <i>any</i> of your data anywhere other than on your own device.</p>
    <p>Privacy-first analytics (from <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/">TelemetryDeck</a>) is used to capture high-level, completely anonymised app usage data so I can improve the app. Examples of the analyics captured are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>iOS version, device model, app version, and language</li>
      <li>Options you have enabled in the app, without capturing any data you've entered manually</li>
      <li>The <b>number</b> of products, customers, and orders in your database, without capturing any of their details</li>
      <li>The format you choose to export orders (PDF/CSV/email)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Things I don't and will never capture:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any of <i>your</i> personal details or any personal identifiers</li>
      <li>Any of your <i>product</i> names, prices or identifiers</li>
      <li>Any of your <i>customer</i> details</li>
      <li>Any of your <i>order</i> details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This page (and this website as a whole) has no tracking, no ads, no cookies, no nonsense.</p>
    <p>If you contact me for support through the app, you'll be given the <i>option</i> of attaching your data files if it's relevant to your problem. This will <em>only</em> be used to help diagnose any issues, and any records would be deleted as soon as we've resolved the problem.</p>
    <p>There's nothing more to say than that. Ethics. Refreshing, eh?</p>
